Welcome to bootcamp!

This is a small bootstrap/framework based on Sinatra and it uses the Twitter bootstrap and cucumber for testing and BDD.

It even includes a small sqlite sample database with a test admin user and user level user.

The default logins are as follows:

Admin Login:
	Username:  admin
	Password:  admin

User Login:
	Username:  user
	Password:  user

You will need to edit the config.yml file to reflect the username and pathing for your app. 
You might be able to just replace "username" with the user you are running it under, depending on your configuration.

Run bundle to grab all the gems you'll need.

Then you can get going. 

To stop/start thin server:
./control.sh stop
./control.sh start

NOTE:  This will spawn 2 servers on ports 4567 and 4568.

This app can easily sit behind nginx by adding something like the following to your config:

upstream www_mydomain_com {
  server 127.0.0.1:4567;
  server 127.0.0.1:4568;
}

server {
  listen    www.mydomain.com:80
  server_name  www.mydomain.com live;
  access_log /path/to/logfile.log

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://www_mydomain_com;
  }

}

Visit http://localhost:4567 in your favorite browser.
